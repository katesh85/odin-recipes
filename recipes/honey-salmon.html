    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These air fryer honey Sriracha salmon bites are cubes of salmon, lightly
      seasoned with salt, pepper, olive oil, and a touch of Sriracha, then air
      fried to crispy perfection and drizzled with a bold, sticky honey-Sriracha
      sauce. These bites are perfect as an appetizer, rice bowl topping, or
      paired with a side of roasted vegetables.
