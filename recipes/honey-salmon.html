    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These air fryer honey Sriracha salmon bites are cubes of salmon, lightly
      seasoned with salt, pepper, olive oil, and a touch of Sriracha, then air
      fried to crispy perfection and drizzled with a bold, sticky honey-Sriracha
      sauce. These bites are perfect as an appetizer, rice bowl topping, or
      paired with a side of roasted vegetables.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Honey-Sriracha Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sriracha</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon rice vinegar</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Salmon</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound center-cut salmon fillet, skin removed</li>
      <li>1/2 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1/2 tablespoon Sriracha</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
      <li>1 green onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Whisk soy sauce, honey, 1 tablespoon Sriracha, rice vinegar, and
        granulated garlic together in a small bowl. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pat salmon dry and cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes. Toss salmon in olive oil,
        1/2 tablespoon Sriracha, salt, and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spray basket of the air fryer with cooking spray. Place seasoned salmon
        in the basket of the air fryer, working in batches to avoid
        overcrowding, if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook in the preheated air fryer for 4 minutes. Gently turn salmon pieces
        and cook until salmon flakes easily with a fork, 3 to 4 more minutes.
        Place on a serving platter, drizzle with honey-Sriracha sauce, and
        garnish with green onion and sesame seeds. Serve immediately.
