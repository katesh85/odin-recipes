    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These air fryer lamb chops marinate with minced fresh herbs, then cook to
      perfection in the air fryer in under 10 minutes. Roasted potatoes and a
      green salad make excellent side dishes.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1 lemon, zested and juiced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh oregano</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh mint</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary</li>
      <li>3 teaspoons minced fresh parsley</li>
      <li>4 (1/2-inch-thick) lamb loin chops</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine olive oil, lemon zest and juice, salt, pepper, garlic, oregano,
        mint, rosemary, and parsley in a large resealable plastic bag. Gently
        squeeze contents inside the bag to mix.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add lamb chops, squeeze out as much air as possible, reseal the bag, and
        marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or up to 4 hours.
        Turn the bag after each hour, to marinate both sides of the chops.
      </li>
      <li>
        When ready to cook, preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees
        C), or according to manufacturer's instructions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add lamb chops to the air fryer in a single layer and air fry for 3 1/2
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn chops and continue to air fry an additional 3 minutes. Test for
        doneness with an instant read thermometer. 120 degrees F (49 degrees C)
        is rare, 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) is medium, and 145 degrees F (63
        degrees C) is medium well. Add time in 1-minute increments to achieve
        desired doneness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tent with foil and allow to rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
