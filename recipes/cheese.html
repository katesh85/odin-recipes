    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pimento cheese is a Southern classic, and also a component of the
      legendary sandwich at the annual Masters golf tournament. For an updated
      twist, combine it with juicy tomato on some crusty bread, air fry to
      toasty perfection, and you will have the ultimate sandwich.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 slices country-style French bread, or bread of choice</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
      <li>1/2 cup pimento cheese spread</li>
      <li>1 tomato, sliced</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon dried basil</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the air fryer to 370 degrees F (188 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Spread one side of each bread slice lightly with mayonnaise. Lay 2
        slices of bread, mayonnaise side down, and evenly spread with pimento
        cheese; top with tomato slices. Sprinkle with basil and season with salt
        and pepper. Top with remaining 2 bread slices, mayonnaise side up.
      </li>
      <li>
        Move sandwiches to the air fryer basket. Place a toothpick in the center
        of each sandwich and air fry until bread is fully toasted and golden
        brown, 8 to 10 minutes, flipping halfway through.
      </li>
      <li>Remove toothpick from sandwich, slice in half, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
